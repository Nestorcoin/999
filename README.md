[CoiniumServ](http://www.coiniumserv.com) is a high performance, extremely efficient, platform-agnostic, easy to setup pool server implementation. It features stratum and vanilla services, reward, payment, share processors, vardiff & ban managers, user-friendly embedded web-server & front-end and a full-stack API.

Even better multi-pool & auto-exchange module is being developed which once completed will allow you to setup pools that can pay users in any crypto-currency that can be traded over exchanges.

CoiniumServ was created to be used for [Coinium.org](http://www.coinium.org) mining pool network at first hand. You can check [some of pools](https://github.com/CoiniumServ/CoiniumServ/wiki/Pools) of the pools running CoiniumServ.

### Development

##### Model

* We have implemented extensive [tests](https://github.com/CoiniumServ/CoiniumServ/tree/develop/src/Tests) for all important functionality and never merge in code that breaks tests and stuff. Yet again, when a new functionality is introduced we also expect proper tests to be implemented within the PR. In simple words, most probably you won't notice any functionality-breaking changes within the repository.
* A strict ruleset for the [Development Model](https://github.com/CoiniumServ/CoiniumServ/wiki/Development-Model). You can follow our bleeding-edge [Develop](https://github.com/CoiniumServ/CoiniumServ) branch or stay with-in the stable [Master](https://github.com/CoiniumServ/CoiniumServ/tree/master) branch.
